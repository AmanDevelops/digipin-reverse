## DIGIPIN REVERSE

Digipin Reverse is a FastAPI based application to convert the Standardized DigiPIN to an actual Human Readable Address. This application will use OpenStreetmap's [Nominatim API](https://nominatim.org/) to perform the desired action. Nominatim is the geocoding software that powers the official OSM site www.openstreetmap.org. It serves 30 million queries per day on a single server.
